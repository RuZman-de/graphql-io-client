About
-----

This is a [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) network communication framework for
JavaScript clients, running under either Node.js or in the Browser.
It is based on the GraphQL engine [GraphQL.js](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/), the
GraphQL client library [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client), its
WebSocket network interface [Apollo Client WS](https://github.com/rse/apollo-client-ws)
and the HTTP client library [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios). It has be used
with the corresponding [GraphQL-IO-Server](https://github.com/rse/graphql-io-server)
network communication framework on the JavaScript server side.

Installation
------------

```shell
$ npm install graphql-io-client
```

Usage
-----

```js
/*  all-in-one  */
import { Client } from "graphql-io"

/*  client-side only  */
import { Client } from "graphql-io-client"
```

See the [TypeScript type definition of the GraphQL-IO-Client API](src/graphql-io.d.ts) for details.

Sample
------

```js
/*  Hello World Client  */
const { Client } = require("graphql-io-client")
const client = new Client({ url: "http://127.0.0.1:12345/api" })
await client.connect()
let result = await client.query("{ hello }")
await client.disconnect()
console.log(result.data)
```
